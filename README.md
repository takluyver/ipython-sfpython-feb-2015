This was my half of a talk about IPython, given jointly with [Min RK](https://github.com/minrk).

Open `Talk.ipynb` in the IPython notebook, or
[view it on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/takluyver/ipython-sfpython-feb-2015/blob/master/Talk.ipynb)
(the interactive widgets won't work on nbviewer).

Slideshow mode used the [live_reveal](https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal)
extension.
